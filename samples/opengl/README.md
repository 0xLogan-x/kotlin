# OpenGL application

 This example shows interaction with OpenGL library, to render classical 3D test model.

To build use `./build.sh` script without arguments (or specify `TARGET` variable if cross-compiling).

To run use

    ./OpenGlTeapot.kexe

It will render 3D model of teapot. Feel free to experiment with it, the whole power of OpenGL
is at your hands.
